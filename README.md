# DynamicLoad
DynamicLoad is build using Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, jQuery. Also to fetch gifs I am using giphy.com's API.
Check it online http://www.vladstadnyk.us/dynamicLoad/
Run locally - you need to download or clone app and just open index.html

The idea of this app is to show that we can fetch images/gifs/etc based on the ViewPort of user. My implementation should recognize
when a userâ€™s browser has scrolled far enough down a page to an image container
(a placeholder for the not-yet-loaded image) and only then make the request to
load and display the image.

For more explanation how it works check comments in app.js
